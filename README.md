Idea for the project came from <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/web-projects-with-vanilla-javascript/?utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=udemyads&utm_campaign=WebDevelopment_v.PROF_la.EN_cc.ROW_ti.8322&utm_content=deal4584&utm_term=_._ag_80385735315_._ad_535397279730_._kw__._de_c_._dm__._pl__._ti_dsa-774930035449_._li_1028595_._pd__._&matchtype=b&gclid=CjwKCAjw4qCKBhAVEiwAkTYsPPLLIUGIHeZhaBe2l9mziYC8ZLqcH_K2_0snpeXVmotmfniVO53SZRoC5DEQAvD_BwE">here<a/>  (again :)). I watched the intro video, and got familiar with what the app is supposed to do.
After that, I recreated the same form element with a slightly different appearance, and JS code that is completely mine.
HTML, CSS, JS
